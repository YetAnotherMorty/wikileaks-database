<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" ><tr><td valign="top" style="font: inherit;"><DIV id=yiv1945967926>
<DIV>&nbsp; First off i would like to apologize to anyone that recieves this e-mail by mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to stay off the net and my phone book is old.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don'y even know who is who half the time on here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if this went to you by mistake, you could care less or whatever reason please just delete it.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sending this out to make clear what happened before it gets out of hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is exactly what happened to me yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (keep this in mind that this is what happened, wether they are telling the truth is another story)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early yesterday morning i was awoken by a strange phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp; The man said he was a federal agent and wanted to speak to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked him what about.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said they had a significant threat that i was going to attack obama and his followers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, i told them fine that i would meet them, rather then being picked up and taken in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met up with two men.&nbsp;&nbsp; One said he was with the secret service and the other showed a badge and said he was with the FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked them what it was all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me Hal Turner called the marshal services and said that i called him drunk and said i was going to the obama celebration with a mortar to fire into the crowd to try to kill obama and his followers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, at first i kinda chuckled.&nbsp;&nbsp; but when they started telling me that they had sniper teams looking for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kinda got serious.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they were going to kick in my door.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, i asked them why were you going to kick in my door when like the report said i was supposedly going to the obama celebration?!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me that was when they figured out it wasn't legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (not that a guy carrying a mortar tube and rockets thru the subway didn't sound believable! LOL!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that they asked me a barage of questions stemming from have i ever had any special weapons training to have i ever been hospitalized with any mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The questions ended with why do you think mr. turner
 would make these allegations against you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told them i have no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; Me and Hal have always gotten along in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was even nice enough to host a radio show for me in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained i haven't talked to him in over a year and that i resigned from the TCM a couple months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of numerous reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus i just had a new baby boy 5 days ago and kinda don't have time for any juvenile movement shit.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They told me that they didn't think there was legitimacy to it and they dropped me off at my aprtment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't heard anything else about it since.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon as got home&nbsp;i called Hal and asked him what the hell was going on?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he didn't know and that it was the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put Hal on this mailing list specifically so he knew exactly what was going on and being said by me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to belive hal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are allot of fishy things going on with all of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one, out of all the people i know in the movement why did they pick to use hal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they were just stirring up shit then why not use someone i don't get along with.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know hal likes media attention and what would make for a better story then " Former leader of the WCOTC arrested for plot to assinate obama and followers"&nbsp;&nbsp; They would have had&nbsp;a field day with that!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what would Hal have to gain by that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And why would he do it to me?&nbsp; I have dealt with allot of fucked up and confusing crap in my life but this takes the cake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when i have
 been trying to step away from the movement so i can get my personal life back on track.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways i thought i would let everyone know from my mouth before it gets twisted around from all the net junkies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone has any questions call me because i don't own a computer and only come to the library to use the public ones about every 2 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you will have a easier time calling me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 309 830 9485.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Logsdon</DIV></DIV></td></tr></table><br>
