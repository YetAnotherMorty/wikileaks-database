 <b><font size="+3">Ukraine: Construction Begins On World's Largest Jewish Community Center</font></b> <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn3/JohndeNugent/?action=""><img src="" alt="" border="0"></a>  <br> <br> DNEPROPETROVSK, UKRAINE -- (August 4,  2008) <br> by R. C. Berman  <br> <br> <br> (lubavitch.com) Straddling two blocks, a $60 million, 400,000 square foot Jewish Community Center and Holocaust Museum now under construction in Dnepropetrovsk will be a city within a city, a showcase for a Ukrainian industrial backwater waking up to boom times in Jewish and civic contexts. <br> The seven-tower, twenty-story museum and center multiplex will stretch around the existing Golden Rose synagogue is sweeping in its scope of programs. <br> ?Any Jewish person, any age and every time of the day will
 have a reason to spend quality time at the center,? said Dnepropetrovsk?s Chief Rabbi and Chabad-Lubavitch representative, Shmuel Kaminezki. At maximum capacity, the center will hold over 10,000 people, a chunk of Dnepropetrovsk?s 50,000 Jews. <br> Funded by Gennady Bogolubov, president of the Jewish Community of Dnepropetrovsk and partner in the international industrial firm Privat Group, the center  will cement the city?s  Jewish renaissance. <br> A Jewish mall in the center will offer easy access to kosher food and lifestyle necessities on a level unfathomable in the lean days of the communist and immediate post-glasnost era. Kosher restaurants, coffee shops, fast food joints, an Internet caf&#xE9;, a bookstore, Judaica store, supermarket and pharmacy will line the first two floors of the center. Currently, ten tons of kosher meat products are produced in Ukraine, including ten different kinds of deli meats, per month. When the center is completed, demand is expected to grow
 further. <br> Above the mall, floors of auditoria and suites will become home to programs for children, children with special needs, women?s groups, adult education and seniors. A wing is reserved for Jewish courses offered to the community?s college students and for its on-site business school. Teachers at the school and community workers will live in the 30 apartments within the complex. <br> <br>  <br> Now suppose the  white Aryan Americans said ?we  NEED any Aryan community center just like that, but ten times bigger!?? <br> <br> Well, that is what I do say and that is what I do predict: an Aryan America center ten times bigger her in the white heartland of America, near Pittsburgh. <br> <br> What is the purpose of such a Jew center:?  <br> <br> To intimidate.  <br> <br> To gloat.  <br> <br> To revel in one's power.  <br> <br> German cultural philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche may have been thinking of the Jews when he wrote his famous/infamous book <i>Der Wille zur
 Macht</i> [?The Will to Power?]. But the difference between Jew power (and the Jews are now only 1% of Ukraine) and Aryan power is that theirs rests on a steady stream of lies, brainwashing, police and economic terror, whereas our message of white healthy, pride, and power goes WITH the grain of our peoples. Our message makes our folk joyful; it is natural and it is wholesome. Given a choice, our  white world will OF COURSE  choose to live long and prosper. Ninety percent of Ukraine's Jews left the country after the 1991 breakup of the USSR, fearing the wrath of the Ukrainians for their role in Bolshevism, the crimes of Stalinism and the Jewish ?oligarchs'? post-Soviet, hyper-capitalist takeover of the economy. <br> <br> The world's most famous white civil rights activist, former Louisiana state representative <a rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.davidduke.com/">David Duke, not only earned his PhD in history at the MAUP university in Kiev, the capital of
 Ukraine, but also lectured in history there for several semesters</a>. Duke told me on several occasions that no real Ukrainian is shocked by or gets "politically correct" about honest, even public antisemitism. "Anyone can talk about the Jews right on the street corner and no one will turn around," Duke told me. <br> <br> At least three and probably four million Ukrainians perished during the  Marxist-Jewish <i>Holodomor</i>, literally the  ?starvation-death,? a gigantic famine which the native Georgian Joseph Stalin ordered inflicted on the occupied Ukrainians in the 1930s (with the help of the non-Jew Nikita Khrushchev), It was a merciless policy of seizing food and even seed corn that dozens of Jewish Marxist functionaries, Jewish torturers and Jewish NKVD secret police officials implemented with relish so as to exterminate the independent farmer class, the kulaks, and crush any spirit of rebellion in the ?antisemitic? Ukrainians. <br> <br> <br>

He was referring to a private Israeli group Georgia had hired. <br> <br> Yakobashvili, Georgia's minister of reintegration, said this training enabled Georgia to defend itself against Russian forces in the warfare that erupted last week in the separatist region of South Ossetia, Georgia. <br> <br> Yakobashvili said a small group of Georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire  Russian military division, thanks to the Israeli training. <br> <br> "We killed 60 Russian  soldiers yesterday alone," said Yakobashvili.

"Every bomb that falls over our heads is an attack on democracy, on the European
 Union and on America." <br> <font color="green"><b>[JdN comments: He sounds desperate.]</b></font> <br>   <br> ++++++++++ <br> <br> War in Georgia: The Israeli connection <br> <br> For past seven years, Israeli companies have been helping Georgian army to preparer for war against Russia through arms deals, training of infantry units and security advice <br> <br> Arie Egozi <br> <br> The fighting which broke out over the weekend between Russia and Georgia has brought Israel's intensive involvement in the region into the limelight. This involvement includes the sale of  advanced weapons to  Georgia and the training of the Georgian army's infantry forces. <br>   <br> The Defense Ministry held a special meeting Sunday to discuss the various arms deals held by Israelis in Georgia, but no change in policy has been announced as of yet. "The subject is closely monitored," said sources in the Defense Ministry. "We are not operating in any way which may counter Israeli interests. We
 have turned down many requests involving arms sales to Georgia; and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized. So far, we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures." <br> Israel began selling arms to Georgia about seven years ago following an initiative by Georgian citizens who emigrated to Israel and became businesspeople. <br> "They contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that Georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing Israeli weapons," says a source involved in arms  exports. <br>   <br>  The military cooperation between the countries developed swiftly. The fact that Georgia's defense minister, Davit Kezerashvili, is a former Israeli who is fluent in Hebrew contributed to this cooperation. <br>   <br> "His door was always open to the Israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in Israel," the source said. "Compared to countries in Eastern Europe, the deals
 in this country were conducted fast, mainly due to the defense minister's personal involvement." <br>   <br> Among the Israelis who took advantage of the opportunity and began doing business in Georgia were former Minister Roni Milo and his brother Shlomo, former director-general of the Military Industries, Brigadier-General (Res.) Gal Hirsch and Major-General (Res.) Yisrael Ziv. <br>   <br> Roni Milo conducted business in Georgia for Elbit Systems and the Military Industries, and with his help Israel's defense industries managed to sell to Georgia remote-piloted  vehicles (RPVs), automatic  turrets for armored vehicles, antiaircraft systems, communication systems, shells and rockets. <br>   <br> According to Israeli sources, Gal Hirsch gave the Georgian army advice on the establishment of elite units such as Sayeret Matkal and on rearmament, and gave various courses in the fields of combat intelligence and fighting in built-up areas. <br> <br> <b>'Don't anger the
 Russians'</b>  <br> <br> The Israelis operating in Georgia attempted to convince the Israeli Aerospace Industries to sell various systems to the Georgian air force, but were turned down. The reason for the refusal was "special" relations created between the Aerospace Industries and Russia in terms of improving fighter jets produced in the former USSR and the fear that selling weapons to Georgia would anger the Russians and prompt them to cancel the deals. <br>   <br> Israelis' activity in Georgia and the deals they struck there were all authorized by the Defense Ministry. Israel  viewed Georgia as a  friendly state to which there is no reason not to sell arms systems similar to those Israel exports to other countries in the world. <br> <br> As the tension between Russia and Georgia grew, however, increasing voices were heard in Israel particularly in the Foreign Ministry calling on the Defense Ministry to be more selective in the approval of the deals with Georgia for fear
 that they would anger Russia. <br> "It was clear that too many unmistakable Israeli systems in the possession of the Georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as Russia is concerned," explained a source in the defense establishment. <br>  For instance, the Russians viewed the operation of the Elbit System's RPVs as a real provocation.  <br> "It was clear that the Russians were angry," says a defense establishment source, "and that the interception of three of these RPVs in the past three months was an _expression_ of this anger. Not everyone in  Israel understood the  sensitive nerve Israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with Russia are highly tense." <br> In May it was eventually decide to approve future deals with Georgia only for the sale of non-offensive weapon systems, such as intelligence, communications and computer systems, and not to approve deals for the sale of rifles, aircraft,
 sells, etc. <br> <br> A senior source in the Military Industry said Saturday that despite some reporters, the activity of Georgia's military industry was extremely limited. <br> "We conducted a small job for them several years ago," he said. "The rest of the deals remained on paper."  <br> <br> Dov Pikulin, one of the owners of the Authentico company specializing in trips and journeys to the area, says however that "the Israeli is the main investor in the Georgian economy. Everyone is there, directly or indirectly." <br>   <br> <b>Georgian minister: Israel should be proud</b>  [sic] <br> "The Israelis  should be proud of themselves for the Israeli training and education received by the Georgian soldiers," [Jew] Georgian Minister Temur Yakobashvili said Saturday. <br>   <br> Yakobashvili is a Jew and is fluent in Hebrew. "We are now in a fight against the great Russia," he said, "and our hope is to receive assistance from the White House, because Georgia cannot survive on
 its own. <br> <br> It's important that the entire world understands that what is happening in Georgia now will affect the entire world order. It's not just Georgia's business, but the entire world's business." <br> One of the Georgian parliament members did not settle Saturday for the call for American aid, urging Israel to help stop the Russian offensive as well: "We need help from the UN and from our friends, headed by the United States and Israel. Today Georgia is in danger. Tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too." <br>      <br> Zvi Zinger and  Hanan Greenberg contributed to this report. <br> <br> ===================== <br> <br> Let us recall that Vladimir the Great recently organized a state funeral for Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose 2002 book <i>Two Hundred Years Together</i> <b>red]skewered Russian Jewry</b> for killing 40 MILLION Russians and other Slavs in the Bolshevik "Civil War" on the Russian people and
 in the gulag, where eight of the eleven death camps (WRITES 1974 NOBEL LAUREATE SOLZHENITSYN) were run by Jews, who were however just 1% of the Soviet population. <br> <br> In his previous books, such as <i>The Gulag Archipelago</i>, Solzhenitsyn had also skewered <i>two Georgians</i> who used hundreds of thousands of Jews as secret police to run the mass-murder of the white Russians and Ukrainians -- the Georgians Joseph Stalin and Lavrenti Beria. <br> <br> Jews: the Russians remember you and your Georgian buddies. <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn3/JohndeNugent/?action=""><img src="" alt="" border="0"></a> <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn3/JohndeNugent/?action=""><img
 src="" alt="" border="0"></a> <br> <b>In 1974 and 1975, the great Cossack Solzhenitsyn read Jewmerica the riot act as well, denouncing at a speech at Harvard and from his exile in Vermont liberals, capitalists, atheists and materialists. Like all great Russians, he wanted a West true to its roots. His book <i>Two Hundred Years Together</i> will be accessible in summary form in the September-October 2008 issue of the <a rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.barnesreview.org/">Barnes Review</a>  magazine from Washington, D.C. I  translated the excellent German summary of this massive, 700-page book which never before has appeared in English. I recommend you pre-order this special, unique issue from <i>The Barnes Review</i> at (202) 544-5977! If you thought you knew all about the Jewish role in Bolshevism, you don't until you read the great Solzyhenitsyn. And then you will understand why
 the Jews have blocked this book from appearing at all in the English language. </b><br> <br>    "He who tells the truth should have one foot in the stirrup." --Turkish proverb</div></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br>        </blockquote><br>
