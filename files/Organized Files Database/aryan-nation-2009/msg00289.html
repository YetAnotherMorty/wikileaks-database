You truly get your money's worth seeing how we defeated the freedom-hating, conference-sabotaging JEW and held first-rate speeches. <br> <br> I was very touched at this conference by<i> 9/11 widow</i> Ellen Mariani's presentation. By the way, her lawyer -- in suing the federal government to get the facts about the murder of her husband and 3,000 others on 9/11/01 -- was <b>Philip Berg, </b>whose lawsuit demanding that the Obamanation produce his <i>birth certificate</i> will go before the U.S. Supreme Court on December first!  (Mariani does NOT trust
 him.....)<br> <br> Someone needs to "hold Obama's feet to the fire" on this. And I have a plan to do that.<br> <br>  ========<br> Just about every White in Pennsylvania is part-German, and this is reflected even in the snacks  here, from our local supermarket where blond kids stock shelves: <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>There are so many "Snyders" here (from the German name <i>Schneider, </i>meaning "tailor") that they have to state which town they are from! Some are from Berlin and others from Hanover! Mind you, these are place names in <i>Pennsylvania!</i></b><br> <br> This area is also FULL of Ron Paul supporters. (Paul is from this Western Pennsylvania area; his grandfather was a German immigrant.) I got a call to attend an "End-the-Fed" last Saturday (11/22/08) in downtown Pittsburgh in front of the Federal Reserve branch here. I saw some 25 RP folks (including MANY young
 people and cute young ladies; interesting how RP in his seventies attracts and enthuses them).<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>A black cop  told us not to use a bullhorn, but our voices echoes loudly enough on this main thoroughfare among the cavernous federal buildings -- and MANY honked approval as they drove by us.</b><br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Myself talking with several RP people; all there, by opposing the Fed, seem to <i>also know about the Rothschild connection </i>and thus about the Jewish issue. This meetup group was almost 100% white, and braved blasting winds and cold for over three hours to blast the Fed parasite back.

(next to Dr. Duke and James Edwards)<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <br> ......posted the comment and info below about the worldwide Somali plague of illegal immigrants and rapists. (And these Muslim Africans are working now in every airport in the world, from Minneapolis -- I saw them in December '07 on the way to giving a speech in Arizona -- over to Reykjavik, Iceland! Henrik saw them in Iceland too on his way to America!)<br> <br> And indeed, as the Stephen Foster song that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hotshare.net/en/audio/95495-4460984e59.html" target="_blank">Margi

Now I do believe in angels, as do very many other Americans. And I believe in them for two good reasons, dating back to 1989 and 1990 (although that is another story), and now I think something weird just happened again.<br> <br> I was at a local post office to mail out some more of the "No More War for Israel" DVDs and to inquire about a US postal money order -- sent to
 a comrade in England and yet no bank in England would cash it! (I had sent it to a South Africa comrade stuck there in dire  straits. He has no bank account. He really needs help!! He's been eating one potato a day for a week! As a  white man he cannot go on the dole, after all, only <i>Jamaicans. </i><b><font color="Red">And the US government refused him even a tourist visa to visit the U.S.: on "suspicion of intent to immigrate"!</font></b>)<br> <br> His name is Mark Singleton, known as "Marwinsing" -- illegally "legally" stranded and broke in Europe, thanks to Michael Chertoff, and actually starving, living on one potato a day, and here is his amusing, touching and unique website: <br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://marwinsing-marwinsing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://marwinsing-marwinsing.blogspot.com/</a><br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Mark Singleton, former soldier for the white
 race in Angola, former police officer, whose <i>aged parents</i> have even been harassed with a <i><font color="Red">bank-robbery accusation</font></i> by the now black-ruled police force!!! -- because Mark dares to speak out. (Look at  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://johndenugent.com/wsat.html" target="_blank">Deirdre Fields' powerful webpage on my site about South Africa</a>.) Help me help Mark, who has done superb work for me from his trailer via Internet connection. He had a PR business for 12 years and has vast website skills, but the Jew Chertoff will not let this suffering, starving, courage-filled, talented white man into America.</b><br> <br> Anyway, I talked with a helpful lady postal clerk who was baffled by why the Brits would refuse to even deposit his US postal money order and she referred me to her manager with this conundrum.<br> <br> So I moved down the counter and spoke with this gentleman, who was rather helpful and sympathetic verbally, although he could not make the
 limey government cash the USPS money order. (Maybe they think it might bounce, like our whole economy is  doing!) <br> <br> BTW, I finally wired this comrade some money by Western Union, although he lives far away from any WU office. It is  an outrageous tragedy that has befallen this valiant comrade, who fought in Angola against the communist black armies there and was a police officer who protected whites and blacks from the savagery that now reigns supreme. (He is also a gifted website designer and PR man, and a good-looking chap to boot, ladies.) Now, thanks to bad luck and the U.S. government, he is in absolute limbo and destitute. "No Whites Wanted even as tourists!" -- sez Michael Chertoff. "They could immigrate here!" That is one reason I ask you to buy this excellent NMWFI set, to <i>help me help comrades</i> who are fantastic and deserve our help. (If you want to Western-Union him some money, send me a PM! It will only cost you the sum plus $15.00 all the way to
 England.)<br> <br> In any case, the post office was now closing and I had to wrap up the conversation. At  that moment the lady postal clerk <font color="Navy"><i>interrupted her manager....and me.....to swivel her computer monitor toward me  and to exclaim: "You should play these [lottery] numbers!"</i></font><br> <br> It was these:<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>See the numbers below the word "BIG4."</b> <br> <br> Of course the numbers did not win, but I never before had a perfect stranger urge me to bet on any number, nor to interrupt her direct superior, her BOSS, to do so!<br> <br> <b>H</b>enrik <b>H</b>olappa and I were joking about this afterward, since his initials are "HH." <br> <br> Anyway, I'm sure it meant nothing.....<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"></blockquote>I thank all who have ordered for $75
 the excellent six-DVD set of "No More Wars for Israel" from me at 213 Ekastown Road, Sarver PA 16055! <br><br></blockquote><br>
