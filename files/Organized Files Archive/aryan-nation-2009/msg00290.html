SCOTUS Docket
 No. 08-570 contains the details. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-570.htm" target="_blank">http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08-570.htm</a><br> <br> A review of that  docket and the Rule 10 of the Supreme Court makes abundantly clear that Justice Souter's granting of a review on the Writ of Certiorari is not a right entitled to citizen Phil Berg, but rather is a matter of judcial discretion based upon a <b>compelling reason.</b> That compelling reason is the Constitutional requirement that <br> <br> <div style="margin: 5px 20px 20px;">  <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Quote:</div>  <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">  <tbody><tr>   <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset ;">         "No person except a natural born citizen  ... shall be eligible to the office of President..."       </td>  </tr>  </tbody></table> </div> What this means is that on or before 1 DECEMBER 2008 Barack Hussein Obama
 II must respond to the writ of  <i>certiorari,</i> and since the Berg v Obama case hinged primarily on the question of Obama's place of birth, it is almost inconceivable that Barack Obama will thumb  his nose at the Justices of the Supreme Court and he is absolutely compelled to provide a vault copy his original birth certificate.<br> <br> Another very salient fact to consider at this time is that, despite all of the pronouncements of the print and broadcast media, <b>Barack Obama is not yet the President-elect of the United States.</b> Barack Obama can only become the President-elect after the Electoral College convenes on 15 DECEMBER 2008 in their respective state capitals around the nation and casts their votes to elect the President and the Vice President. As you can see this election day occurs two weeks after the required response to the Supreme Court granted Writ of Certiorari.<br> <br> The bottom line is this: the presidential election of 2008 remains an ongoing
 process, the outcome of which  remains undetermined, and all talk about a potential Constitutional crisis in the United States are at least 36 days premature.<br> <br> The inevitable constitutional  crisis regarding President-elect Obama, of course, revolves around his <b>inability (or unwillingness) to produce an authentic Hawaiian birth certificate with the raised certificate stamp</b> that the Federal Elections Commission can independently verify.<br> <br> Here are some of the unanswered issues hanging over the head of President-elect Barack Obama and the question of his American citizenship:<br> <br>  &#xB7;  The allegation that Obama was born in Kenya to parents unable to automatically grant him American citizenship;<br> <br> &#xB7; The allegation that Obama was made a citizen of Indonesia as a child and that he retained foreign citizenship into adulthood without recording an oath of allegiance to regain any theoretical American citizenship;<br> <br>  &#xB7;  The allegation that
 <b>Obama's birth certificate was a  forgery</b> and that he may not be an eligible, natural-born citizen;<br> <br> &#xB7; The allegation that Obama was not born an American citizen; lost any hypothetical  American citizenship he had as a child; that Obama may not now be an American citizen and even if he is, may hold dual citizenships with other countries. If any, much less all, of these allegations are true, the suit claims, Obama cannot constitutionally serve as president.<br> <br> &#xB7; The allegations that "Obama's grandmother on his father's side, half-brother and half-sister claim Obama was born in Kenya," the suit states." <br> <br> Reports reflect Obama's mother went to Kenya during her pregnancy; however, she was prevented from boarding a flight from Kenya to Hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy, which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight. Stanley Ann Dunham (Obama) gave birth to Obama in Kenya, after which she flew to Hawaii and registered
 Obama's birth."<br> <br> &#xB7; The claim  could not be verified by inquiries to Hawaiian hospitals, since state law bars the hospitals from releasing medical records to the public;<br> <br> Even if Obama  produced authenticated proof of his birth in Hawaii, however, the suit claims that the U.S. Nationality Act of 1940 provided that minors lose their American citizenship when their parents expatriate. Since Obama's mother married an Indonesian citizen and moved to Indonesia, the suit claims, she forfeited both her and Barack's American citizenship.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> To this I add:<br> <br> Frank Davis alias Obama (see my explosive webpage <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.johndenugent.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, with the audiofile BARACK'S DANGEROUS BLACKMAILABILITY (radio ad; 60 seconds), and my hair-raising documentation <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.johndenugent.com/blkmailobama.html" target="_blank">here</a>, has committed a stupendous fraud, taking hundreds of millions in campaign
 contributions while KNOWING he is not even  a U.S. citizen!!!<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Who exactly took this  and other nude "glamor shots" of Ann Dunham, the mother, if not Frank Davis, writer of the porn novel <i>Sex Rebel: Black?</i> Why does Barry, the supposed president-elect, look so much like Frank Davis -- a communist, pedophile and porn writer?</b><br> <br> Is his goal to provoke a race war??? Or to DELIBERATELY trample on the Constitution??? To so blatantly violate it that OTHER provisions are de-sanctified, such as the BILL OF RIGHTS???<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> Here is what a keen-eyed Canadian wrote:<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> written by Tom Waite, November 25, 2008<br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.obamacrimes.us/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=25:open-comments&amp;catid=1:open-comments&amp;Itemid=3#comments"
 target="_blank">http://www.obamacrimes.us/index.php?...mid=3#comments</a><br> <br> <font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="3">As a Canadian, I just don?t get it? Most recently I see on CNN and the other American mainstream TV news Barack Obama at a podium  with a sign reading ?President Elect? and Obama presenting his latest cabinet personnel choices. Now it hasn?t taken him much time to just present these people to the press, why can?t he do the same thing for his birth certificate? Something just doesn?t gel?it just doesn?t make any sense because to me he?s acting like a frightened child! It?s no different than with young children presenting a book report in front of class, the kids that have done their homework are the ones who look confident sitting in their seats. But you can always spot the kids who aren?t prepared, only read half the book and are going to try to bluff their way through it. And you can always tell that the troublemakers who refuse to stand up to do
 their presentation when they?re names are called by the teacher are the ones who haven?t  even read their book! And when they do, they stall big time, they?ll talk about anything else but when the teacher finally looses his/her patience and tells these  children to present their book report?their caught with their pants down?their busted!<br> <br> Whenever I see Obama at this podium presenting his cabinet picks, it reminds me exactly of the type of kid who never read his book and he?s stalling big time before he?s eventually caught!<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Frank Davis Jr. "appoints" the smug Israeli Rahm Emanuel as "chief of staff." White America cannot recognize this illegal administration.</b><br> <br> Because I see Obama saying, may I present the next?.and the next?and the next?and I?m like, yes but when are you going to present your birth certificate? And some
 reporters have asked Obama?s press officer about the birth certificate question and the press  officer says, let?s not go there! Let?s not go there?are you kidding? That?s all that matters! Obama is desperately trying to act all presidential by almost everyday  presenting the next person for a cabinet position and yet has refused?absolutely refused to just prove to the press and the electorate that he?s legally eligible to be the next President of the United States! What?s more presidential than the old saying ?The Buck Stops Here?, so that means he just stands up at the podium and says I?m here to dispel all rumours that I wasn?t born in this country. Furthermore, although my mother was a confused free spirit and deliberately chose to marry men who were not American and were men of the Muslim faith that doesn?t give anyone free reign to disparage her reputation! I am an American and I was born in this country (then he pulls out his long form birth certificate) and here is
 the proof! I will leave you now in the capable hands of my representative Mr. / Ms. Whoever  and he/she will answer all your questions, I have better things to do than handle rumours of my citizenship now?I have a country to run?thank you ladies and  gentlemen.<br> <br> See?that?s presidential! What Barack Obama is doing regarding his birth certificate issue isn?t presidential; he?s acting like a frightened child! Rather than ?The Buck Stops Here?, Obama?s motto is ?I?m Passing the Buck?; all he?s doing is hiding behind lawyers. His lawyers are doing is one of two actions, one is to immediately ask for a dismissal and two, is to say that the parties suing them for disclosure of the birth certificate don?t have legal standing! That?s it! There?s nothing more Obama?s lawyers are doing, they haven?t presented their case, they haven?t done anything other than ask for a dismissal or say that the parties suing them don?t have legal standing! Furthermore, why does Obama continual
 pay lawyers in every state to make this issue go away? Why does Barack Obama even need  lawyers in the first place? Is this acting presidential? Mr. Obama a good portion of American citizens think you?re a fraud, does it help by even allowing these  lawsuits to exist? Being presidential means to stand up like a man at the podium in front of the press and just confront your accusers! All anyone is asking is for you to show leadership and say that you?re disturbed that you feel so many of your fellow Americans are saying disparaging remarks about yourself. And that this isn?t the way you imagined you would start out your administration, having to handle lawsuits by average citizens proving your eligibility to hold office.<br> <br> I think it would show not only to Americans but even to enemies of America that you?re not afraid to confront lies and innuendo; if you just handled this issue without lawyers and spoke the truth in a press conference! This would be the first truly
 presidential act you could do?just continually rolling out your latest cabinet picks in  front of the press is meaningless. Just start your administration with the strength of conviction and put the rumours of your eligibility to bed already?well  that?s unless you?re truly lying and just like the child who hasn?t read his book for his presentation?you?re about to be busted!!! </font></font><br> <br> ===========<br> <br> A comrade wrote:<br> <br> <div style="margin: 5px 20px 20px;">  <div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Quote:</div>  <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">  <tbody><tr>   <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset ;">         Hi!<br> <br> Will your book reach out and wake up the whites who are christian zionists &amp; rapture bunnies? one reason many jews are in power is the support from white christian zionists/rapture bunny types. I've noted such support in the Republican party. My local chair is this type. </td> 
 </tr>  </tbody></table> </div>Yes, indeed, the book MUST reach out to these excellent white  right-wing Christians around America who have been blinded by the bogus "Scofield Bible." These should be OUR people; a generation ago they were still properly  wary of Jews. In fact, they are following a MODERN HERESY, and NOT traditional Christianity.<br> <br> I have seen a very scary hatred in their eyes when I criticize Israel. Gone is any shred of Christian love; they look at me as the Antichrist when I bash the "Chosen." I had a shocking experience of this when flying on Northwest Airlines down to Phoenix, Arizona for the Winterfest of the Nationalist Coalition. (See my homepage, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.johndenugent.com/" target="_blank">http://www.johndenugent.com</a>, and the videos of that speech on the right in blue lighting). One stewardess agreed with every word I said about race, but when I got to the Jews, and their banning of Christmas and prayer from the schools, her
 eyes bizarrely hardened in a split second into raw hatred of ME (and not of the Jews who ban  Christian prayer!!) How anti-Christian!<br> <br> Flaming hate!<br> <br> Fortunately, Pennsylvania has just about NO Christian-Zionist megachurches, just the  traditional denominations. At least I have seen none.<br> <br> Your question is so interesting that I will put it in a post.<br> <br> After my folks divorced, my mother dragged me to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.watchtower.org/" target="_blank">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, and I was there from 1970-76 until I broke away at age 21. Although the JWs' teachings differ widely from other Christians' doctrines, they are assiduous Bible-readers and I read the Bible from cover to cover three times -- and the New Testament in the original koin&#xE9; Greek. (I studied both Greek and Latin, Greek at Georgetown and Latin in high school.)<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br>
 <b>After the Jehovah's Witnesses bought this huge building from the Squibb pharmaceutical  company (next to the famous Brooklyn Bridge), one of their many big buildings in Brooklyn Heights, across from Lower Manhattan, I was one of those in 1974 who  scraped off the old paint (seven stories up, on a swinging scaffold) and repainted it yellow. I also saw the World Trade Center being topped off, directly across the East River in Manhattan, and thought to myself at the time that it was the coldest, ugliest steel box in the world, that it was an arrogant symbol that "American money rules the world," and that it would some day, somehow, be destroyed. </b><br> <br> I must say that the JWs have an incredible training program for going door-to-door and getting the average Joe to open his mouth to complete strangers and spread successfully his very unpopular faith. After all, there are now six MILLION of them. I served at their international HQ in NYC (from 1974-75), after years as
 a "pioneer," that is, a full-time preacher (1972-74). Although some of their teachings are  bizarre, there is much I learned from them, and they kept me away from drugs, fornication and much youthful grief.<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Two British JWs; all of them go door-to-door, and get rigorous weekly training in their doctrines and in how to evangelize others. I still have these skills -- for a new use.</b><br> <br> And I am in genuine sympathy with Jesus Christ's mission. I can talk very, very easily with Christians, and often attend a different Christian church every Sunday. I talk with the parishioners, the clergyman or -woman, I sit down with them at the coffee or meal after the mass or service, and give them my views.<br> <br> Partly, this is in observance of what Dr. Ed Fields told me: remember that your neighbors will someday be your jurors when the Feds try to
 railroad you.<br> <br> But mostly it is because I AM religious myself. I believe ABSOLUTELY in  life afer death and that a just but loving God WILL judge us.<br> <br> I have had two mystical experiences that for me were proof  enough that a higher power does watch us, one in 1989 and the other in 1990.<br> <br> And I agree with what Hitler wrote in his second book (never published in his lifetime), that cowardice and irresponsibility are the scourges of our age. No man (or woman) can die and face God with a clean conscience who has run from the battle for the survival of our race.<br> <br> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<br> <br> We WILL be judged.<br> <br> DEATH does not end anything.<br> <b><font color="Navy"><br> The best thing you can do for yourself is live as a hero.</font></b><br> <br> John   </blockquote><br><br></blockquote><br><p>
