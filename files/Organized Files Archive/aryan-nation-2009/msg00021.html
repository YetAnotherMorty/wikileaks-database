<DIV><FONT size=3>Yes I sent that e-mail to Jay.&nbsp; Paul Mullet is obviously 
an idiot.&nbsp; Mullet doen't even know me. &nbsp;He is only parroting Jonathan 
Williams in saying I "stole money from the church".&nbsp; I guess that's all 
jonathan can come up with to blast me with since it cant be proven either 
way.&nbsp; Jonathan was a fraud from the start.&nbsp; Everytime Jonathan needed 
money for something in the church, if it was in the account, I sent it to 
him.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=3>Funny, after we parted ways last year that i found out he was 
claiming the website cost more money than it actually did.&nbsp; It costs, 
approximately $12.99 a month and a yearly renewal fee of about $20.00.&nbsp; I'm 
not even going to get into it any further.&nbsp; I'm through with all this 
"movement" drama.&nbsp; I'm Christian Identity.&nbsp; I belong to NO group, 
church, or organization.&nbsp; A lot less stress that way and a lot less people 
to not ever please.&nbsp; The only people that ever paid dues in CJCC-AN were 
yourself and Rich Stantons guys in PA anyway, sad isn't it.&nbsp; That money 
went to merchandise, putting on events, booklets, website and ink, stamps, 
paper, envelopes etc.</FONT></DIV>

  <DIV><BR></DIV>Did you really send this e-mail. Anyway, Paul&nbsp;Mullet says 
  that you stole money from the church. Basically I do not believe him The Feds 
  like to send false e-mails to cause trouble. We have to be on the defense 
  against it. Phone calls are harder to fake since you can recognize the voice. 
  We over in the Northwest have concluded that Paul Mullet could not be a

  <DIV><FONT size=3>Jay,</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3>This is welcome news.&nbsp; Now I wont feel bad continuing 
  to ignore them.&nbsp; Henry Stout has been blowing my phones up for the past 
  two months.&nbsp; I refuse to talk to him and while he was calling from his 
  Texas number, I just wouldn't answer the phone.&nbsp; Too agravating and 
  nothing to say except just to talk.&nbsp; Then one day a call comes in from 
  our area code and my wife answers, it's him.&nbsp; I don't know if it's a 
  calling card or how he pulled that one.&nbsp; This guy was associated with us 
  while we had CJCC going.&nbsp; He was constantly calling wanting to send money 
  or have merchandise made.&nbsp; Neither money or merchandise ever showed that 
  he was supposedly sending.&nbsp; We chalked it up to him being a kid that was 
  probably a little slow.&nbsp; I don't know for sure, never met the guy.&nbsp; 
  </FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3>The message he left my wife was wanting "permission" to use 
  the Church name.&nbsp; After your e-mail to me, I presume now that&nbsp;he was 
  talking about CJCC/AN.&nbsp; He's a nut.&nbsp; He just wants someone to talk 
  to him on the phone.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3>Paul Mullet, came to us in AN from Minnesota.&nbsp; We were 
  under the impression he couldn't go back there (crimes).&nbsp; He made some 
  screwed up comments at a meeting in Georgia concerning planting "pipe bombs" 
  on the perimeter of the property we were on and I didn't want to even be 
  around him after that.&nbsp; R. Spring and J. McManus were there when comment 
  was made.&nbsp; Also, R. Stanton can verify this.&nbsp; Jonathan Williams 
  brought him in, so Mullet most likely is tainted.&nbsp; Mullet, after living 
  in Georgia for a while, got on meth and migrated south to Louisiana.&nbsp; He 
  called me after I cut ties with Jonathan Williams.&nbsp; Jonathan is, in my 
  opinion, an agent/informant for the ADL.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3>As far as UCOY is concerned, that is my church.&nbsp; I am 
  not a pastor, so I keep the website up for informational purposes only.&nbsp; 
  I haven't decided if I'm going to keep it going or not.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3>As my heart is not in it anymore, I am glad you are 
  continuing AN.&nbsp; By the way, the "conquerwemust" email was Jonathans at 
  gmail.&nbsp; So, Henry Stout is also working with Mullet to aide Jonathan in a 
  good ol boy round-up most likely.</FONT></DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
  <DIV><FONT size=3>Good heads up Brother.&nbsp; Good hearing from you.&nbsp; 
  Don't be a stranger.</FONT></DIV>

    Henry and advised that he had been pulled over by the Texas State Police, 
    and would be running a little late, &#xBD; hour from Texarkana. Mullet was again 
    pulled over and this time arrested in Texarkana later that date, Mullet 
    contacted Henry&#x2019;s mother, [who lives at a separate residence] from a 
    Texarkana police facility, and stated that he had been arrested. Later, Mr. 
    Stout contacted the Texarkana Police, as well as the Texas State Police, who 
    stated that they had no record of a Paul Mullet being arrested, detained, or 
    even pulled over. </FONT></P>

    Texarkana immediately went North, phoned Pastor O&#x2019;Brien claiming to be on 
    his way to the real Aryan Nations, claiming to be in Minnesota, driving west 
    to Idaho. Mullet set up residence in Idaho, not his &#x201C;New Home in Ohio&#x201D;, took 
    a part time job as a cleanup person at a resort, and on this income, was 
    able to room and feed himself, set up websites plural, print out fliers, 
    etc. Upon meeting O&#x2019;Brien, his tactic was to talk crap about Commander 
    Schoep and Pastor Faber, whom he only knew via phone for less than two 
    weeks, worming his way into position to gain names and other info. O&#x2019;Brien 
    states that Mullet was never able to ascertain such information, however, 
    apparently Henry Stout received the U.C.O.Y. list for Mullet from Williams.

    comments. Be it also known that Mullet is the one claiming to be holding the 
    next &#x201C;Aryan Nations Congress&#x201D; as seen on his website, whom Henry Stout 
    facilitated, by his own admission, with the help of the son of the IKA 
    leader, who does web design, the same also produced Henry Stout&#x2019;s new 
    &#x201C;church&#x201D; site, and facilitated the use of the IKA grounds in Tennessee. It 
    is assumed that the son of the IKA leader is unaware of who he is working
