<tt>Greetings Pastor Jon/Senior Pastor-- We got this off the web with respect to 
</tt><tt>crafting an A/N Worship team. I used to be a Full Gospel Church of San Diego 
</tt><tt>Song Leader. With respect to operations, we will run this within the 
</tt><tt>framework of the AZ-CA Joint Staff agreement......
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Respectfully,

Bob,Facilitator
Church of Jesus Christ Christian ,
Arizona Worship Team




Worship Team Definition
</pre><tt>The Worship Team consists of those persons involved in leading the people in 
</tt><tt>corporate worship. Although we generally only think of the Worship Leader 
</tt><tt>and musicians as making up the Worship Team, it in fact consists of at least 
</tt><tt>the following individuals:
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Musicians;
Hand signers;
Singers;
Overhead projectionists;
Mixing board operators;
Home Group Attendance
</pre><tt>We believe that at New Wine, Home Care Groups are our life blood (until God 
</tt><tt>tells us otherwise). Our vision is to build New Wine upon relationships 
</tt><tt>rather than on talents and gifts, and the Home Care Groups serve as the 
</tt><tt>primary centres for building these relationships. It is in the Home Care 
</tt><tt>Groups and through the relationships developed there, that our vision of the 
</tt><tt>church is imparted to new members of New Wine.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It is not out of a desire to see prospective Worship Team members perform 
</tt><tt>that attendance is required. Rather, it has been our experience that until 
</tt><tt>new members of New Wine become committed to a Home Care Group they do not 
</tt><tt>integrate fully into the life of the church. Therefore, we require that 
</tt><tt>until one is committed to a Home Care Group he will not be considered for 
</tt><tt>membership on a Worship Team.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

A Worshipper First
</pre><tt>The Father seeks true worshippers: those who worship in Spirit and in truth. 
</tt><tt>Also, in the body of Christ we lead through service. Therefore, as it is the 
</tt><tt>purpose of the Worship Team to lead the people in worship, it is a necessity 
</tt><tt>that Worship Team members be able to worship; regardless of their place in 
</tt><tt>the church, or the surrounding circumstances. If an individual cannot 
</tt><tt>worship then he will be unable to lead others in worship. Being a worshipper 
</tt><tt>is more important than being a musician or technician.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

A Servant Second
</pre><tt>In the body of Christ we lead by serving. Unless a Worship Team member is 
</tt><tt>willing to give himself to service, he will be unable to lead others in 
</tt><tt>worship. While not everyone has service as a primary motivational gift, 
</tt><tt>everyone can develop a servant's heart. All Christians should be seeking 
</tt><tt>this heart attitude, in any case.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

A Team Member Third
</pre><tt>Worship Team members are just that: Members of a team. Unless they are able 
</tt><tt>to submit themselves to the Team leadership, and integrate and work with the 
</tt><tt>other members of the Worship Team, they will hinder rather than help lead 
</tt><tt>the people in worship. We do not expect that conflict will never exist. But, 
</tt><tt>team members need to be able to allow iron to sharpen iron by dying to self. 
</tt><tt>Crucifying the flesh doesn't mean nailing your brother to the cross!
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Whether a prospective Worship Team member fits in can only be determined as 
</tt><tt>relationships are built between existing and prospective Worship Team 
</tt><tt>members. While New Wine presently has a single Worship Team, we may 
</tt><tt>eventually have more than one. And, we recognize that a prospective team 
</tt><tt>member may fit better into one group than another.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

A Musician/Technician Fourth
</pre><tt>Excellence, not perfection is demanded of Worship Team members. Team members 
</tt><tt>must be proficient enough with their instruments and equipment to perform 
</tt><tt>the duties required. Whether a member is proficient enough will be 
</tt><tt>determined on a individual basis.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>As always, attitude is as important as aptitude. As Christians we are called 
</tt><tt>to do everything as unto the Lord. In other words, we are to perform our 
</tt><tt>duties &quot;in excellence.&quot; From a performance perspective, excellence is 
</tt><tt>different for someone with a year's experience than for a ten year veteran. 
</tt><tt>However, there shouldn't be any difference in attitude between two such 
</tt><tt>individuals.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Must Be Teachable
</pre><tt>No matter how long we perform a task, there is always room for improvement. 
</tt><tt>Members of the Worship Team must always remain teachable that we may 
</tt><tt>continually hone our skills. God is always doing something new, and unless 
</tt><tt>we remain soft and flexible we will not be able to move with Him.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>It is also expected that team members will individually pursue further 
</tt><tt>training, where it is appropriate. For seasoned musicians this may take the 
</tt><tt>form of refresher courses in technique, or further theory; while for 
</tt><tt>technicians it would probably involve something else.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Common Vision
</pre><tt>A prospective Worship Team member must share the vision we have for worship; 
</tt><tt>or he must be willing to buy into New Wine's vision. Unless all team members 
</tt><tt>share a common vision, there will be unnecessary tension within the team. 
</tt><tt>For example, if one team member wants a C&amp;W sound, and another a Rock sound, 
</tt><tt>there will always be friction. Any such friction will hinder the teams 
</tt><tt>effectiveness in ministry.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
