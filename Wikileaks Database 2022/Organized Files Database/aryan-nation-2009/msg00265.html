In a world of talkers, they acted on their beliefs, risking everything -- their freedom and their lives. Bob Mathews, whom I met at his last appearance as a member of the National Alliance in 1983, lost his life, burned to death on Whidbey Island, Washington. His speech at the 1983 Alliance
 convention in Chicago (where I also spoke) was incredible.<br> <br> When Matthews said it was time for the white man to fight, I knew, and we all in that audience knew, that unless he followed up this fiery speech, this exhortation to action, with something more than a literature throw on on  some neighorhood lawn, he was blowing hot air -- but the white man named Robert Matthews was not.<br> <br> It might be prudent to distance myself from these warriors, who made the choice to go illegal and rob banks full of Fed paper to fund the Cause, and some actually killed a Jew  talk show host. I of course do not advocate violence.<br> <br> But their motives were not for self but for the saving and re-growing of our white nation. I understand their frustration and salute their courage, although I do not advocate violence or illegality.<br> <br> Our valiant young Finnish comrade Henrik Holappa has been in contact for six persistent years as a "pen pal" -- even from faraway Finland
 -- with Richard Scutari, an Order comrade who recently and outrageously was reclassified a "domestic terrorist' and moved to a Super-Max federal dungeon in Illinois. <br> <br> I sent him the postcard below.<br> <br> YOU should write Richard, or another Order prisoner!<br>  <br> Richard Scutari #34840-080<br> USP Marion - CMU<br> PO Box 1000<br> Marion, IL 62959 <br> (USA)<br> <br> Richard was a combat scuba diver with the US Navy and, because of his security background, could have helped the Order avoid some errors.

 Can you imagine: at Christmas 2005 Richard Kemp got ONE Christmas card. and from whom? Henrik Holappa from Oulu in Finland!!<br> <br> From this you can see that we whites need to become a true Tribe, and no longer just an opinion demographic.

Henrik tells me that Richard loves getting postcards of Europe, our Mother Continent.<br> <br> I had wanted to keep this card for myself as a token of my visit in Brussels in March 2007 to the heroic Vincent Reynouard, a Holocaust revisionist who is now
 on the run after being sentenced to one year in prison by the Judeo-French government, with another year's imprisonment to follow in Judeo-Belgium. The authorities do not care that the man has seven beautiful children and to feed and  that his wife has nightmares, especially after the Brussels police threatened to smash up the apartment because he refuses to meekly turn himself in!<br> <br> Here is a pic of Vincent, a Traditional Catholic and national socialist.

 the 1st or 2nd class Iron Cross. After the war Steiner was found  not guilty of any war crime and released in 1948. Steiner still kept in contact with his Finnish SS-volunteers and twice visited Finland in the 1950's to see his old brothers-in-arms.

"Lowrey Turney"] goes back to Germany</b><br> <br> The War between Finland and Soviet Union had ended in September 1944. Captain T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was discharged from the army after six years of service. The legendary platoon leader and commander was now without
 any work. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was wandering around Finland  after the war. He had lost his home in Vyborg (now Soviet) and he really had no good civilian education. All he had ever wanted to be was a soldier. Because of the peace treaty with the Soviets former SS soldiers were not allowed to work in governmental offices. The Soviets did not trust men trained in Germany and fighters against the Soviets wearing the SS-uniform.<br> <br> Lauri T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni could not accept the fact that -- for Finland -- the war was over. He strongly believed the war could have been won by cooperating totally with the  Germans, but instead of fighting in Karelia (the Finnish area Stalin had ripped away from the Finns), Marshal Mannerheim and the Finnish army had switched sides and even started waging war against their erstwhile German allies up in Lapland (in northern Finland) &#xE2;?? albeit they did so only under massive Soviet pressure. (Stalin in early October '44: "If you do not attack the Germans in Lapland
 within 48 hours, the Red Army  will enter Finland to help you.") <br> <br> In the fall of 1944 the Germans were leaving his country via southern Finland and offered to help any Finn as they could. The German Gestapo officers promised to take as many Finnish volunteers to Germany with them as wanted to join. The decision wasn't difficult for T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni left his parent's house in Vaasa and arrived in the capital, Helsinki where he and his former SS friend Jalo Korpela were recruited by the Finnish Gestapo contact John Artur Hj&#xC3;&#xB6;rklund. On the 23rd of January 1945 T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and 20 other  Finnish SS-volunteers stepped into a <i>Kriegsmarine</i> submarine that would take them to Germany.<br> <br>  <b>Plans to liberate Finland</b><br> <br> During the Lapland war it was widely thought that when the Germans left northern Finland, the Soviets would invade this area (called Lapland for the semi-Asiatic people who live up there), because it was still a strategically important area.
 Even before  the Lapland War Germany's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler had negotiated with some high-ranking Finnish officers, such as Lieutenant Colonel Fabritius, to start up an armed resistance movement against the Soviets in Finland should the USSR occupy the country. <br>  <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>The Lapplanders, a white people with some Asian blood, speaking a Finno-Ugrian language, inhabit much of the sparsely populated north of Scandinavia.  They herd reindeer, keep to themselves, and get along well with the Norwegians, Swedes and Finns to their south.</b><br>  <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br>  <br> <br>  The RSHA (<i>Reichssicherheitshauptamt</i>, "Reich Security Head Office") agreed to recruit Finns to organize sabotage and spy activities  against
 Soviet military forces. In the RSHA a plan was even afoot to make Finland the last nest of National Socialist resistance, and a location that could also offer shelter to some National Socialist leaders. <br> <br>  (This information comes from <i>Suomen Kuvalehti</i> [&#xE2;??Finnish Picture&#xE2;??] magazine (like the old &#xE2;??Life&#xE2;?? magazine), which published an article about T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and his part in organizing a resistance movement in Finland (Week 37/2003). According to this magazine, T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni met with Ribbentrop and the <font color="Black">Germans were willing to appoint Captain T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni  as the head of the  entire resistance movement in Finland.</font><br> <br> In February 1945 T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and 30 other Finns started their training in a newly formed special unit called &#xE2;??Sonderkommando Nord&#xE2;?? in Heringsdorf on the Baltic. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and the others got trained for counter-intelligence, sending Morse messages and handling powerful explosives and weapons. All soldiers  got NCO training although
 most of the volunteers were young men with no previous war experience. <br> <br> After the training the Finns were sent to the legendary SS Major Otto Skorzeny's &#xE2;??Jagdregiment 1&#xE2;??. The regiment was famous for its operation that liberated Benito Mussolini. Untersturmfuehrer T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was now responsible for training the new recruits, who were mainly Finnish POWs captured by Germans in the Lapland War, Finns who had changed sides because they were sick of having to obey orders to shoot, on Soviet demand, at the Germans, their former brothers-in-arms for years. The Soviet invasion in the east forced the  training center in Heringsdorf to be moved to the Danish border in Flensburg.<br>  <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Skorzeny, the greatest commando who ever lived.</b><br> <br> T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni felt frustration. He wanted action. He was discussing Germany's  military situation with the Finnish resistance
 contact, Lieutenant Colonel Fabritius. Fabritius told T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni the situation at the front was &#xE2;??chaotic.&#xE2;?? Fabritius was still negotiating with General Kaltenbrunner about anti-Soviet activities and resistance in Finland. Fabritius went back to Finland together with his German Gestapo contact. Fabritius was arrested later for being pro-German and he died in a Finnish prison in 1946.<br> <br> T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni volunteered for the front with his old SS comrade Korpela. They were sent to the &#xE2;??eastern front&#xE2;?? -- which then, sadly, was east of Berlin. But T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was eager to get some last blows in against Bolshevism. <br> <br>  <b>Berlin April&#xE2;??May 1945, and the return to Finland</b> <br> <br> Lauri T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and Korpela reported for military service directly to SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Felix Steiner. On the 15th of April Steiner appointed T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni a Hauptsturmfuehrer (captain). Korpela was not appointed. The defenders of  Berlin had a terrible lack of weapons; T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and Korpela were only
 given pistols, rifles and one submachine gun. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was in charge of an SS company of about 300 men. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and his company were fighting on the north side of Berlin near Schwerin. On the 25th of April Russian troops broke through in Nauen, and Berlin and its outlying areas were now about to be encircled by a huge Soviet army. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and his company withdrew to a small town called Pritzwalk, with the Russians after them. In Pritzwalk T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni had a combat encounter with the Russians, but he led the company so well that it gave him and the company time to withdrew to Hagenow. The Russians then encircled T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and his company in  Hagenow. <br> <br>  On 3rd of May T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni heard of Hitler's death.<br>  <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>The last picture of Hitler: Berlin, 30th of April 1945.</b><br>  <br> <br> The  company decided on one last combat operation &#xE2;?? to break through the Russian lines. The
 break-out was successful, but then they ran into American paratroopers on the west of Berlin who captured T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and his company. Lauri T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni's war for Berlin was now over. His company had not suffered huge losses, but it had killed many raping Bolsheviks. <br>  <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>True brotherhood. SS soldiers helping a comrade during battle somewhere on the eastern front in  August 1944.</b><br>  <br> <br> The Americans handed T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and Korpela over to the British army, because Great Britain and Finland were still in war. They  were sent to Oldenburg with German prisoners of war. T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni did not plan to stay for a long time in the hands of his enemies and after few nights observing the British and their guard practices, T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni made his move and with  Korpela escaped from the camp.<br> <br> <img src="" alt=""

Almost half the rapists were not Russians, but yellow-skinned and slant-eyed men from the Caucasus mountains and  beyond. The Soviet propaganda minister, Jew, Ilya Ehrenburg (1891-1967) encouraged them to rape the &#xE2;??blond witches&#xE2;?? and break the &#xE2;??racial pride of the Germanic woman.&#xE2;??<br>  <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Ilya Ehrenburg, Ernest

Even anti-Hitler historians now consider the book a worthless piece of defamation.</b><br> <br> Again T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was in a situation where he had to abandon a city he cared about to murdering Bolshevists, twice his home city of Vyborg and now the capital of the German Reich, Berlin. However, T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni was not sure what kind of  welcome home he would get in Finland. With the help of various Germans T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni and Korpela got to Copenhagen and were able to get fake IDs and find a ship  heading for the city of Turku in Finland. From Turku T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni moved to Helsinki and worked in a electric company that was owned by former SS soldiers and members of the
 resistance. <br>  <br> <br> However, in the meanwhile the communist police VALPO (State Police) had gotten wind of T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni's return and of Waffen-SS soldiers planning resistance to Soviet forces. Soon VALPO was ready to take action against the &#xE2;??traitors.&#xE2;??<br> <br> Lauri T&#xC3;&#xB6;rni's story (later that of &#xE2;??Larry Thorne, US Army Special Forces) will be continued. . . .<br> <br>  * * *<br> <br> <b>Some Finns of the Viking Division. . .</b><br> <br> About 1,400 Finns volunteered for the Waffen-SS between the years 1941-43 and 1944-45. Few soldiers who decided to stay in the Waffen-SS after 1944 could ever go back home to Finland after the war, because they were henceforth  to considered to be &#xE2;??traitors.&#xE2;?? They had in fact disobeyed orders to not come home to the Finnish Army or be  discharged; after January 1945 there really was a small, albeit reluctant war between the Germans and the Finns up in Lapland; and of course postwar Finland had to keep Stalin happy by
 persecuting the former Waffen-SS men -- or he might invade, occupy the country and deport hundreds of thousands of innocent Finns to Siberia as he had done to civilians and soldiers in the neighboring Baltic states. <br> <br> Besides the Red Terror, Stalin could also have brought in Russians to settle in and colonize Finland, as was done with neighboring Estonia, whose capital Tallinn is in fact full of Russians. (They are 26 percent of the country.)<br> <br> Many of these Finns who volunteered for the Waffen-SS had served with bravery in the Finnish army during the Winter War of 1939-40, and for them it was a horrible to be classified by the postwar government as a &#xE2;??traitor&#xE2;?? to the  country they had loved and fought for.<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0">   <b>One of the famous Finnish Waffen-SS-soldier was Ulf-Ola Olin.</b><br> <br> SS-Obersturmfuehrer Ulf-Ola Olin. Finnish army officer, 2nd lieutenant,
 born in 1917. Like many Finnish men, he served in the Winter War of 1939-40, then volunteered for the Waffen-SS in 1941 and decided to stay in the SS until the end. He commanded the 5th Panzer battalion of the Viking-SS division.<br> <br> He was.awarded the Iron Cross, first class, second class and the one of the highest medals of all, the German Cross in Gold. Olin led tanks in many famous battles against the Soviets on th eastern front in 1945, never losing his tank. After the war he was a POW and was declared a &#xE2;??traitor&#xE2;?? by the postwar Helsinki government. He decided to stay in Germany and married a German woman. He finally visited Finland again in 1968, but returned to Germany, and  he stayed loyal and active in  the postwar SS soldiers' organization HIAG. He died in 1995 and was buried in Kassel.<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>The German Cross in Gold</b> <br> <br> SS-Untersturmfuehrer Unto Parvilahti was
 a true &#xE2;??political soldier&#xE2;?? in the Finnish SS battalion. He was openly a National Socialist and ended his letters with the sacred words: &#xE2;??Heil Hitler.&#xE2;?? Parvilahti also created plans for a Greater Finland (which, like Greater Germany, would reunite all who spoke the mother tongue), and he disagreed with Finnish Army HQ on how things were performed. Parvilahti openly said the Finns should cut off the Murman railway (from the vital Soviet port of Murmansk to Leningrad).and attack Leningrad from the north while the Germans were doing so from the south (which Marshall Mannerheim refused to do). <br> <br> After the war the Soviets captured Parvilahti and he spent 10 years in the  gulag in Siberia.   With strong <i>sisu</i> (Finnish for "toughness and bravery") Parvilahti survived the prisoner camps and came back to Finland. He was not, however, pleased with the political situation and moved to Spain, dying in Malaga in 1970 (where his neighbor was Belgian Waffen-SS
 general Leon Degrelle. Later the heroic Austrian revisionist Gerd Honsik lived in Malaga, now bravely facing 20 years in prison for his poems and books after his extradition back to Austria.) <br> <br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>SS-Hauptsturmfuehrer Jouko It&#xC3;&#xA4;l&#xC3;&#xA4; in his office in the Waffen-SS HQ in Berlin.</b><br> <br> It&#xC3;&#xA4;l&#xC3;&#xA4; [pronounced &#xE2;??EE-tell-eh&#xE2;??] was one of the few high-ranking Finnish officers who stayed in the SS after 1943. After the war he was a prisoner of the Russians. His fate is unknown.<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br>   <b>SS-Obersturmbannfuehrer  Kalervo Kurkiala, the Father of the Finnish SS battalion.</b><br> <br> Kurkiala was an admired and appreciated man among the Finnish volunteers and among the Germans. One of the Finnish volunteers described his amazing spirit with the words: &#xE2;??His presence gave us
 the strength to stand the pressure of hard military service so far from home.&#xE2;?? He stayed in Germany till the end and was captured by the Soviets. After his time in a POW camp he moved to Sweden and died in the 1970s.<br> <br> <img src="" alt="" border="0"><br> <b>Welcome to the Eternal brotherhood! Finnish Waffen-SS volunteers in 1943.</b><br> <br> Over time those soldiers have been forgotten, and were despised by the government. Many of the SS soldiers had only each other after the war, and the brotherhood and friendship that were born in the horrors of the front. <br> Although  few are still with us now, they always stood in the  front lines of the race war, defending Europe, Europeans and European-Americans. Postwar governments betrayed them, but they have stayed loyal to their oath.<br> <br> In these moments I can only salute those brave men with the words:<br> <font size="4"><br>
