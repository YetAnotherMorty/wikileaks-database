I am a single white man who currently lives in the supreme cesspool of Los Angeles and
 am looking to relocate. From what I've gleened, even the Pacific Northwest is steadily being infiltrated by mestizos. I've been considering the northeast as the alternative. I've looked at prices of homes there, and for the price of a condo here in L.A., you can get a nice little house on an acre or two of land near Portland, Maine, which is over 90% white in the whitest state in the country. <br> <br>When I heard your interview and you talked about how attractive Pennsylvania was, I looked up some prices on realtor.com and it looked even cheaper than Maine --- almost too good to be true. Would you mind narrowing down some  areas  for me in Pennsylvania to check prices on? <br> <br>Some counties or areas which you think are desirable would help me focus on those places so I can start getting an idea of what the possibilities are, prices, property taxes, etc. <br>  <br>Thanks for any suggestions. <br>[/quote] <br> <br>=========== <br> <br>I responded: <br> <br>* * * <br>
 <br>Dear white brother, <br> <br>The greater Pittsburgh area is truly magnificent -- and VERY low-priced. (It lost literally half its population -- half its owners and renters -- during the worst of the Rust Belt days in the 1970s and 1980s.) <br> <br>Have you seen my serious posts discussing Pittsburgh and its vicinity? (We live in exurbia 25 minutes NW of the city, and love both the city and the countryside here.) <br> <br>Here are a few: <br> <br>--http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showpost.php?p=5762053&amp;postcount=4 <br> <br>--http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showpost.php?p=5789626&amp;postcount=11 <br>   <br>--http://www.thephora.net/forum/showpost.php?p=563805&amp;postcount=261 <br> <br>--http://www.libertyforum.org/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=news_arts&amp;Number=296038142&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=21&amp;vc=1&amp;t=0#Post296038142 <br>
 <br>--http://www.libertyforum.org/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=news_arts&amp;Number=296055907&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=21&amp;vc=1&amp;t=0#Post296055907 <br> <br>Further, white brother, I intend to make Pittsburgh into the Munich of North America, the epicenter of our political rebirth. <br> <br>You may call me to discuss your move. We love it here, and so will you. I guarantee it -- if you as a Californian can take a cold winter -- three months of snow and bare trees. I personally love snow and the four seasons. <br> <br>By the economy having been flat from 1970-1995 it is still 90% white, 10% black just as it was back in 1970 -- almost no Mexicans or Asians have ever moved in, and many of the Jews   have moved away for Green-baumer fields. <br> <br>Most of all, EVERYONE here is racially conscious, more even than the Deep South where I have also lived (GA, LA) or the Upper South (TN and VA, where I have also lived). <br> <br>As James Carville once said
 about attitudes: "Pennsylvania is Philly in the east, Pittsburgh in the west, and Alabama in between." But I would say MORE so. <br> <br>And with so many Eastern Europeans here you have a deep antisemitic bedrock, and with so many German-Americans here (the largest group) you have a group that is very sick and tired of the Holocaust and wants its pride back. I speak from experience. <br> <br>Best to you, white brother, <br> <br>John de Nugent <br> <br>PS The counties around here in Greater Pittsburgh are ALL very nice in every way, and all are cheap in terms of housing prices. Due north of Pittsburgh is however less cheap. <br> <br>The truly super-cheap areas DO have blacks and they do have crime; but there is very   little "white-trash" element. There are abandoned homes but the inhabited ones are usually kept up quite nicely all over this region. <br> <br> <br>As a treat for your eyes and your soul, white brother, you must check out this great visual website:  <br>
 <br></div><center><b><font size="+3"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pittsburghskyline.com/">http://pittsburghskyline.com</a></font></b></center> <br> <br>Freeport is an awesome and affordable town nestled in the mountain ridges and rivers -- just five minutes from us. Near fast highways into Pittsburgh, shopping, with great schools and all the rest. <br> <br>But it's <i>ONLY</i> 98.4% white.
