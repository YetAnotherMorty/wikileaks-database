PREFACE<br>
<b>1. Scope</b><br>
The <b>Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms </b>(short title:<br>
Joint Pub 1-02 or JP 1-02) sets forth standard US military and associated terminology to encompass<br>the joint activity of the Armed Forces of the United States in both US joint and allied joint<br>operations, as well as to encompass the Department of Defense (DOD) as a whole.  These<br>military and associated terms, together with their definitions, constitute approved DOD<br>terminology for general use by all components of the Department of Defense.  The Secretary of<br>Defense, by DOD Directive 5025.12, 23 August 1989, <i>Standardization of Military and Associated<br>Terminology</i>, has directed the use of JP 1-02 throughout the Department of Defense to ensure<br>standardization of military and associated terminology.<br>
<b>2. Purpose</b><br>
This publication supplements standard English-language dictionaries with standard<br>
terminology for military and associated use.  However, it is not the intent of this publication to<br>restrict the authority of the joint force commander (JFC) from organizing the force and executing<br>the mission in a manner the JFC deems most appropriate to ensure unity of effort in the<br>accomplishment of the overall mission.<br>
<b>3. Application -- DOD and NATO Activities</b><br>
JP 1-02 is promulgated for mandatory use by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Military<br>
Departments, Joint Staff, combatant commands, Defense agencies, and any other DOD<br>components.  DOD terminology herein is to be used without alteration unless a distinctly different<br>context or application is intended.  To provide a common interpretation of terminology at home<br>and abroad, US officials, when participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)<br>or dealing with NATO matters, will use NATO terminology.  When a NATO standard for a term<br>or definition does not exist, applicable DOD terminology (if any) may be used.<br>
<b>Note concerning DOD-NATO Standardization:  </b>The United States is a signatory to NATO<br>Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 3680, which ratifies the <b>NATO Glossary of Terms<br>and Definitions (English and French) </b>(short title: AAP-6).  Under the provisions of STANAG<br>3680, AAP-6 is established as the primary glossary for NATO.  The United States carries out its<br>obligation to implement STANAG 3680 in the following manner:  (a) English-language entries<br>approved for AAP-6 may be proposed by DOD elements for inclusion in JP 1-02 as DOD-<br>NATO entries.  The purpose of such proposals is to increase multinational standardization.<br>After  DOD-wide staffing by the US NATO Military Terminology Group (USNMTG),<br>terminology so approved for inclusion in JP 1-02 and DOD-wide use will appear, along with<br>DOD-only entries, in JP 1-02 with an asterisk in parentheses after the term to denote DOD-<br>NATO standardization of terminology, referred to as "alignment" in NATO.  (b) As stated in<br>paragraph 3, US officials will adhere to NATO terminology when engaged in NATO matters,<br>
JP 1-02<br>

As Amended Through 12 July 2007<br>
provided that applicable terminology exists.  (c) An electronic copy of AAP-6 is provided under<br>"Other Publications" at the internet address cited in paragraph 7.<br>
<b>4. Criteria for Terms</b><br>
The following criteria are used to determine the acceptability of terminology for inclusion<br>
in JP 1-02:<br>
a. Inadequate coverage in a standard, commonly accepted dictionary, e.g., by Merriam-<br>
Webster.<br>
b. Terminology should be of general military or associated significance.  Technical or<br>
highly specialized terms may be included if they can be defined in easily understood language<br>and if their inclusion is of general military or associated significance.<br>
c. Terms for weaponry are limited to generic weapon systems.<br>
d. Unless there are special reasons to the contrary, terms and definitions are not to consist<br>
of or contain abbreviations or other shortened forms, e.g., acronyms.<br>
e. Only UNCLASSIFIED terminology will be included.<br>
f. Dictionary entries will not be provided for prowords, code words, brevity words, or<br>
NATO-only terms.<br>
g. Dictionary entries will not be Service-specific or functionality-specific unless they are<br>
commonly employed by US joint forces as a whole.<br>
h. Dictionary entries will not consist of components or sub-components contained in<br>
missiles, aircraft, equipment, weapons, etc.<br>
<b>5. Other DOD Dictionaries</b><br>
Other dictionaries or glossaries for DOD use will be published ONLY AFTER coordination<br>
with the USNMTG and approval by the Director for Operational Plans and Joint Force<br>Development (J-7), Joint Staff.<br>
<b>6. Publication Format</b><br>
This edition of JP 1-02 has been published in two basic parts:<br>
a. <b>Main Body.  </b>This part of the dictionary contains all terms and definitions approved for<br>
use within the Department of Defense, to include those terms and definitions that are approved<br>for both DOD and NATO use.  Each entry approved for both DOD and NATO appears with an<br>asterisk in parentheses, i.e., (*), after the term to denote DOD-NATO acceptance.<br>

<b>Note:</b>  In rare instances, a term may have a combination of DOD-only definitions and DOD-<br>NATO definitions.  In these instances, though an asterisk will appear after the term to denote<br>DOD-NATO standardization, DOD-only definitions will be preceded by "DOD only" in<br>parentheses.<br>
b. <b>Appendix A.  </b>Appendix A contains a listing of current abbreviations and acronyms in<br>
common use within the Department of Defense.  This is by no means a complete list of DOD<br>abbreviations and acronyms. Rather, it serves as a guide to current DOD usage in abbreviations<br>and acronyms.<br>
<b>7. JP 1-02 on the Internet</b><br>
a. JP 1-02 is accessible on-line at the following internet address:<br>
http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict<br>
and the following NIPRNET address:<br>
https://jdeis.js.mil<br>
where it is available in both electronic publication and searchable database formats.<br>
b. As changes are approved for JP 1-02, they are added to the internet version, making the<br>
internet version of JP 1-02 more up-to-date than any printed edition.  The internet version thus<br>provides the latest changes worldwide between regular printed editions.<br>

<b>fire support coordination line --</b> A fire support coordination measure that is established and<br>
adjusted by appropriate land or amphibious force commanders within their boundaries in<br>consultation with superior, subordinate, supporting, and affected commanders.  Fire support<br>coordination lines facilitate the expeditious attack of surface targets of opportunity beyond<br>the coordinating measure.  A fire support coordination line does not divide an area of<br>operations by defining a boundary between close and deep operations or a zone for close<br>air support.  The fire support coordination line applies to all fires of air, land, and sea-based<br>weapon systems using any type of ammunition.  Forces attacking targets beyond a fire<br>support coordination line must inform all affected commanders in sufficient time to allow<br>necessary reaction to avoid fratricide.  Supporting elements attacking targets beyond the<br>fire support coordination line must ensure that the attack will not produce adverse effects<br>on, or to the rear of, the line.  Short of a fire support coordination line, all air-to-ground and<br>surface-to-surface attack operations are controlled by the appropriate land or amphibious<br>force commander.  The fire support coordination line should follow well-defined terrain<br>features.  Coordination of attacks beyond the fire support coordination line is especially<br>critical to commanders of air, land, and special operations forces.  In exceptional<br>circumstances, the inability to conduct this coordination will not preclude the attack of<br>targets beyond the fire support coordination line.  However, failure to do so may increase<br>the risk of fratricide and could waste limited resources.  Also called <b>FSCL.</b>  See also <b>fires;<br>fire support.</b>  (JP 3-09)<br>
